# SQL Data Analysis in Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a series of SQL queries executed within Jupyter Notebook for in-depth analysis of a dataset comprising information about artists, works of art, museums, and product details. By leveraging SQL's power, we uncover valuable insights into the relationships between artists, their works, and the institutions that showcase them.

## Key Insights and Queries
- **Artist and Museum Associations**: Investigate associations between artists and museums, revealing where artists' works are displayed.
- **Work Counts and Sales Performance**: Analyze the frequency of works by each artist along with their sales performance, providing insights into popularity and market demand.
- **Top Museums by Work Count**: Identify top museums by the number of works they exhibit, showcasing their significance within the art world.
- **Artwork Styles and Museum Exhibitions**: Explore diversity in artwork styles and their distribution across museums.
- **Financial Performance by Artist**: Calculate total sale prices for each artist's works, highlighting their financial contributions to the art market.
- **Artists' Productivity**: Identify artists with prolific outputs, showcasing their impact and influence.

## Project Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-jupyter-analysis.git` to clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with necessary Python libraries for SQL integration and data visualization.
3. **Execute Jupyter Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`exploratory_analysis.ipynb`) and execute the SQL queries to explore the dataset.
4. **Explore Results**: Analyze the results generated by the SQL queries, visualize insights using charts or graphs if applicable, and interpret findings.

## Next Steps
- Incorporate advanced analytics techniques, such as predictive modeling and trend analysis.
- Explore additional datasets to broaden the scope of analysis and deepen understanding of data-driven decision-making in the art world.
